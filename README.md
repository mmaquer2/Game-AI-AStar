# Project One A-Star

- Demo for the A - Star algorithm in C++ for CS 5150 Game AI at Northeastern University
-  //calculate cost of the new node
   // g = the movement cost to move from the starting point to a given square on the grid, following the path generated to get there.
   // h = the estimated movement cost to move from that given square on the grid to the final destination.This is often referred to as the heuristic,
   // f = sum of g and h
## Set up
